## About 
This project is all about the web of things. Using a nodeMCU we made a game implementing a game where the user has to gues the color of a word.
Using the nodeMCu as a controller with one button the user has to press the box with the right color on it witinh a vertain amount of time. The longer the user plays the shorter time they have.

### [What it should look like](http://imamovicdesign.com/minor/wot/red.html)

## To do / wishlist
- link with node mcu
- game get harder over time (add colored background to confuse more for example)
- add external API (?)
- ..
